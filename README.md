# <Study Guide Webpage for Bootcamp>

## Description

This is a webpage to use as a study guide for people who are going through the prework of the bootcamp. I built this so as to create an easier way of studying the four main topics of the prework. It creates an easy and accessable way to find and use a study guide.
